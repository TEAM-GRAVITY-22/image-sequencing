# Graphical Password authentication System
As we all know that we have a tendency to forget our login passwords easily and we always have to go for "forgot password" most of the time, so to solve this problem we have developed a new prototype of a graphical password authentication system which will allow you to select images sequencially therefore helping you free yourself from remembering different passwords. 

This protytype will save password in an encrytped format that can only be decrypted by the image sequence as provided by you.

# How it works?

In this prototype you need to  select some images in a predefined sequence which will be shuffled everytime you open our prototype. If you correctly select the images sequencially your password will be decrypted and would be shown as an output.
